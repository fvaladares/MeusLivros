# MeusLivros
MeusLivros is a project created during the class on October 29th that shows to students how to work with different screen sizes (smartphones and tablets) using fragments.

Techonologies:
*MVP
*Fragments
*Central repository

This is the first step, when the user can see the mock data on a listview, and when one book is touched the book details will be showed in a new activity, if the user is working in a smartphone, or in the same activity, on the second fragment if the user is working in a tablet.

This example is based on a example from Nelson Glauber's book.

This project will be used as base to work wiht SQlite.

It'll be updated to: insert and remove books from the dataset.
